        I was supposed to be a choir kid: I had been singing for seven years and I loved every part of it. 
        And so, when filling out the course selection form for my freshman year, I had meant to sign up for choir.
        However, I was in a rush and accidentally clicked the box labeled "Introductory Speech and Debate". Oops.
        <br><br>
        At my high school, Speech and Debate and Choir took up an "Extra Period Option". 
        You could do one or neither, but not both. You were allowed to request changes to your course schedule
        after the first two days of the semester had passed, and that's what I was planning to do.
        <br><br>
        That's why I wasn't planning to pay attention to anything the Speech and Debate coach, Mr. Odekirk,
        said on the first day of class.
